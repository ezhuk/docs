Astro Hash is an [Astro Integration](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/) that automatically generates and injects [Subresource Integrity (SRI)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity) and [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP) hashes for CSS and JavaScript assets at build time, helping mitigate supply-chain and cross-site scripting risks.
