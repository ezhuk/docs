Build your site, and Astro Hash will automatically annotate `<link>`, `<style>`, and `<script>` tags in the generated HTML files in the output directory with `SRI` and `CSP` hashes.

```bash
npm run build
```

When the build finishes, take note of the injected attributes and add the generated hashes to your `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP headers so browsers can enforce them.
